Spinball
It's pinball, with a twist. <br>
Spinball is our take on classic 2d pinball. In our game, the player is given the ability to rotate the board, granting greater control over the ball.

Controls
- Q & E to use left & right flippers
- Left & Right arrow keys to spin the board Left & Right
- Spacebar to use ability, some of the abilities require the player to mash the key.
- Tab/P/Escape key to pause game.

Powerups
- Time Freeze
  - Freezes the ball in place, allowing the player to rotate the board to a desired location. Once unfrozen, the ball continues from the new location.
- Multi Ball
  - Mash spacebar to spawn multiple balls into the game, giving players a more confusing experience.
- Extra Ball
  - Mash spacebar to increase balls/lives. Games hard, just making it easier for you.
- Feather Ball
  - Slows the speed of the ball when falling. Just like a feather.
- Ball Saver
  - Saves the ball when it falls into the deep abyss.

Known Issues
- There is some weirdness of the ball when it is offscreen. We made it go offscreen because the ball could get stuck between the edge of the screen and the wall. 
  This forces the ball through the wall. The issue we have by fixing this is that the ball can move around the board offscreen. We have also disabled buttons that are offscreen.
- The mouse is hidden in the enter username/highscore scene because we don't have enough time to build again. It is not a big deal because you can still press enter 
  to submit score. And if left empty, no score is submitted. This makes the visible buttons obsolete.
- The ball tends to dip between the flippers and the death rolles(the large purple things around the edge of the board), the reason we can't fix this was because the flippers 
  would collide with the death rolles and then spazz out.
